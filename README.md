</ul><br>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

1. Install python3

2. Install python dependencies:
<code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code>

3. Selenium requires a driver to interface with the chosen browser. Firefox, for example, requires geckodriver, which needs to be installed before the below examples can be run. Make sure itâ€™s in your PATH, e. g., place it in /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin. Download geckodriver <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases">here</a>.

<li>Python 3:<br>
<code>python3 chessbot.py</code>
  </li><br>
  </ul><br>
 <p>Note: Before running ChessBot, enable the premove and auto-queen option in chess.com settings. If ChessBot is running slow on your computer, lower the number of threads for stockfish engine.</p>
